Alright, what's going on guys, TeploTrades. If you're watching this video, I ended the day with zero wins, one loss. We were on an 8 day win streak and I definitely wanted to get 2-10, but it is what it is. Here was the trade we took. We took this 2 minute gap right here. Unfortunately, today was just a bullish trend day. You could see very clearly off open. We just trended the entire day all the way up here, 150 points. Now, this was the best trade available. Really, there was no trades I was interested in. We're pretty much at all-time highs, so there's no liquidity to be swept. We formed an SMT. I gave this one a B+ we have the bearish SMT here because you could see at the top of the range, ES swept, NQ did not sweep, so you have the bearish divergence. If we go to the hourly timeframe, you can see NQ is rejecting this hourly gap, same with ES. We're in premium of the range. Those were the confluences for the trade. Gave it about a B+ the goal was to go short right there, target the swing point, and get that retracement back into the 50. We even got this 2 minute order block right here forming. I really like it, especially considering at this point, we were sitting for an hour and 20 minutes without a single trade. That was the trade. It stopped out within a couple of candles, and that was that. I lost about $200 on that, so not something we can't come back from. I am going to be trading PM, but if you're watching this, that means I didn't catch a trade in the PM. So that's it. Small loss. We go again tomorrow.
