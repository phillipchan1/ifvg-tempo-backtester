Alright, what is going on? Tempo trades. We are break even to end the week, but overall we are green on the week Yeah, I just wasn't feeling it with the volatility to be honest with you like there's I like volatility don't get me wrong But when when you're getting like 30 to 50 point one minute candles, I'm just like dude I'm not trying to wreck my accounts and all this man So it's it's like a double-edged sword if you guess the move correctly you can make a ton of money Right if you guess the move wrong and you don't risk manage or your executions are off you could blow your account So I was just I was telling my child. I'm like look I'm just gonna paper trade this I also took it on a top-step eval right here getting ready for the payout challenge that is coming Monday So if you want to join us that's Monday in the premium You're gonna go from zero to a payout and document everything on YouTube So here was the main trade it was just a three-minute I effigy reversal off of the four-hour fair value gap If there wasn't even a liquidity sweep here, so I'd probably give this like a B set up But it worked very well just because the volatility is intense you could see where I trimmed and that's about it That's really about it. I did take another trade over here, but it was just a break-even trade off of the Asia sweep And there were no other funded trades for that so That is gonna be it for me again Come Monday come join us if you're buying a prop firm account for the challenge, please use code tempo It supports me more than you know and I'd really appreciate it So I hope you guys have a great weekend and see you Monday
