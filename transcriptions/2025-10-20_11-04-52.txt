What is going on guys? Temple trades? Yeah, today was, listen man, today was supposed to be day one of the challenge, but funny enough, Top Step is currently down. Not even Top Step. Just there is a major outage for Amazon Web Services. Let me try to find the screenshot here. And you can see right here, Top Step actually sent out a message. So, a bunch of websites down, like Snapchat down. Here's the full screenshot, but a bunch of companies are experiencing outages today and that included Project X. So, I literally just couldn't log in, even if I wanted to. Like even if I wanted to take a trade, I couldn't log in today. So, we're literally just moving the day one challenge to tomorrow, acting like today never even happened. Overall today, for the market, it was just a classic trend day. Unfortunately, it does look like we're going to go back to all time highs. We're less than, we're pretty much 100 points away from all time highs now. So, it looks like we're going to go back to all time highs. Still very, very good volatility in the market. We had a 200 point range, even though it was a no news Monday. So, that's like really, really good. It was just in one direction, but I called out this one minute. There was a couple trades, like there was a loss down here for a short, but then there was another win here. So, we kind of broke even on callouts today. This is a, this is an 80 point long right here that we called out on the one minute. Not a ton of confluences on this one either. It's just like, it's a continuation trade with good momentum. And in a trending market, these trades are going to work more than normal, but that's pretty much it. That's all I got. We're acting like today never happened and we're moving day one of the challenge to tomorrow. Hopefully Project X gets their stuff together, man. So, yeah.
