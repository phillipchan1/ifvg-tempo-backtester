What is going on guys tempo trades no trades today man no trace today whatsoever It's got a smile through the pain smile through the pain. It's It's at this point comedy what the market has been just a little PSA I'm gonna start looking at gold in the next couple days. I see other Communities and other people doing the same Like until this government shutdowns over until we get away from all-time highs I'm gonna have to add gold to the arsenal. It is actually I'm working quite similar to how the indices do. I mean you could even see here. We sweep this level Reverse off of it. We come up tap the 50 dump Come up again tap the 50 dump So I might throw some gold trades in there in the next couple weeks. You will see in terms of NQ the only good opportunity the entire day Was at 10 a.m Basically, we swept London high at 10 a.m. And I marked out this 30 second I called it out and I just didn't want to chase for whatever reason just didn't feel comfortable chasing here and This worked for about 30 points. So that was literally the only good one I saw This one was another setup. I saw at like 1045 But I said I wasn't taking it because it wasn't singular and you can see very clearly why singular gaps matter We hit the higher gap and instantly reject and that's a loss. So Yeah, just just playing defensive just literally playing defensive. So no trades for me We got here for 2 p.m. FOMC. We got a 50 point data candle And then basically once Powell got on the podium at 235 We got a crazy like 200 point dump off of something he said But that's honestly just like canceled out now because we're almost all the way back to where we started. So What really got accomplished in the FOMC, you know what I mean? So yeah, that's it. That's it. No trades for me I hope your day went better, but There's probably hundreds of traders out there who are red right now That would love to switch places with me. So it's all about perspective But yeah, let's let's go again tomorrow
