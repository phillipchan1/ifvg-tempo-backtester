What is going on guys? Tempo trades we are reporting live from Korea if you're wondering about the setup so really good day man I mean we were 3 for 4 on the callouts in the stream personally I was 1 for 2 we'll just go over the funded trades so basically the first funded trade was on ES and guys the fact of the matter is the gold is just moving way better than the indices right now will that change in the future probably yeah you know like like NQ and ES are in a phase I think gold or gold is just in a phase you know they're in its own phases so here is the long that I decided to try on ES it was it was only I think I said $200 risk it was just a little take here this was mainly a 30 second long off of this London sweep we were in discount of the range we were also hitting an hourly fair value gap down here so there was a good amount of confluences for this come on ES don't do this to me and just didn't work you know because ES and NQ were just trending bearish today so it didn't work I was down I think $250 off that first trade but we made it all back because we took the gold setup you could see right here that was the loss okay so the fact of the matter is guys gold has just been way better way way way better and we kind of have a textbook set up here it I'll explain so again I said at the start of the stream literally at the start of the stream I said guys I'm marking out two levels I had this I had this low marked out down here hold on so I said at the start of the stream I have this low marked out down here this four hours swing low and then I had this high marked out up here that was London high it was just London high and London low and basically we swept swept London high we did consolidate for a little bit which is pretty much the only negative of the trade which is why I gave an A- we ended up consolidating for like 30 minutes up here but again like gold may have some different characteristics than NQ you know because you could see that once gold did inverse it ended it started picking up momentum here you could see these couple candles right here we started picking up momentum and then once it inverse it just delivered very very cleanly for 17 points you know so it just may have different characteristics characteristics than NQ and that's something that I'll continue to monitor but yeah I gave it an A- I marked it out for like 30 minutes I kept talking about it and the win was much bigger than the loss obviously as you could see I was talking to some gold traders they're like gold and NQ conversions it's like 10 or 10 to 1 or no 10 to 1 or 5 to 1 5 to 1 so they said like a 10 point trade on gold is like a 50 point trade on NQ meaning this would be like a 70 point trade on NQ right here so a really good move really really good move happy with this the crazy part is I was down to one runner I was I was targeting this right here the New York AM low I ended up getting stopped out break even up here and then what does it do second leg goes and hits it so what it whatever it is what it is but yeah and then it's like we just go look at NQ here and it's just like look how bad it is dude like look how bad it is so we come down we sweep London low we do react off London low very nicely the problem was there was no good fair value gaps down here like you could you could go back and look there was no good fair value gaps like these are not singular so you're not taking these there was a 5.30 second gap down here that someone in my chat called out but it's like are you really looking to take a in hindsight it worked but are in the moment are you really looking to take a 5 point I FEG when you you're looking at that much consolidation right there like no you're not you know you're not so yeah that's it I called this three minute out on stream this was just a break even trade it's just chopping around in the gap I don't know gold gold just moving much better man so if you have any questions let me know I'm gonna continue to trade both I simply just in my opinion is I simply just think both of these are in a phase obviously gold's experiencing a ton of volatility and NQ is kind of the opposite it's just like at all-time highs kind of trending most of the time so I'm just gonna take advantage of the opportunities that I'm given and will will adjust and react accordingly so that's it
