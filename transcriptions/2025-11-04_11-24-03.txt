Alright, what is going on guys? We're going to do this very quickly. Guys, I want to do a little Q&A pop quiz real quick. What setup do you think looks cleaner? Do you think this setup looks cleaner? Where we come up, we tap the 50, and we reject with good momentum, and we put in a one-minute or two-minute order block, or do you think this setup is cleaner? Where we chopped up here for 50 minutes, and we were inside of a 60-point range while doing so. Let me know which one you think is cleaner. Anyway, the NQ one worked for 100 points here, and that is just obscene. This is the gold one, which again in my opinion, before the power of hindsight, definitely looked like the cleaner 50% tap. But yeah, that's just how it goes. The other trade was this. This was the first attempt at the 50% tap. This was on NQ, so it was this one right here. And I was aiming for this lower fair value gap. So yeah, those are the two setups. I am exhausted. It is 1.30 in the morning, so short and sweet.
