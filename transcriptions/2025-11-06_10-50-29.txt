Alright, what is going on guys? Tempo trades were coming at you with a trade recap. We sold off a ton today. Yeah, we sold off a ton today. An NQ sold off 360 points as I'm recording this video. It could sell off even more. We don't know. We do have previous day low right here. So that's a daily level. Maybe that creates a little short term bounce. Anyway, I ended up taking a long off gold almost right away market open here. So what was I seeing? Well, we had the London sweep combined with the 50% tap, combined with the V shape momentum, combined with this one minute order block forming right there. So decided to try it. That worked for about 7 points. And that was that here screenshots of me in the trade. So other than that, there were a few NQ trades, couple wins, couple losses that I called out. Like for an example, there was this 30 second that was a break even trade. You had the two minute that went for like 20 points right here. This two minute off the overnight low sweep worked for like 20 points. And then really the annoying one was this. So I called this one minute out here. Obviously the textbook objective play is to go break even once you hit that higher gap. Well, it hits the higher gap right here. Price comes down, takes you out break even, and then it pumped up. So this would have been like a 70 point win. But I think obviously you're doing the right thing here. I feel like you have to go break even there when you hit that higher gap. It's just way too risky not to. But yeah, that was pretty much it for me. For me, it was a very quick day and then I just started calling setups out after that. that so. (laughs)
