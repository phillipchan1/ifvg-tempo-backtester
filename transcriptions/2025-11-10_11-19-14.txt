Alright, what's going on guys? Tempo trades. I'm gonna be quiet and quick because I have a roommate sleeping but basically this is the main trade that we took today. This is a 150 point short right here. Why did we take this trade? Well, we're in premium of the range as you can see right here and we're also rejecting 50% of the one hour fair value gap. So those are the main two confluences why I took this trade right here. Okay, I ended up taking two trades before this. One win, one loss. The other win was the win was on gold. I ended up taking this one minute on gold for about four points because you can see gold swept this liquidity right here. Yeah, so I ended up taking this one minute on gold for about four points. That was just a small win and then I ended up, what did I end up doing? There was another NQ short or something. I don't remember. I don't remember. Was it on ES? I don't remember. I ended up taking an NQ short somewhere for a loss or maybe it was an ES short. Yeah, it was an ES short. Yeah, so I ended up taking this ES short right here. Kind of just the same reason is why I took the 100 point trade. We're just in premium of the range. We're hitting high time frame gaps. So I wanted to catch that reversal but lost a little bit there but it's all good. Doesn't even matter because the third trade was a super banger. Here are the live callouts so you can see. I called this out in real time. I said looking at this two minute IFEG, no entry, still waiting and then it ended up being like it started out as a B plus but I had to downgrade it to a B because of this momentum up here. But once we inverse you can see the momentum picks up and we sell off very, very nicely. So yeah, that's it. Two wins, one loss. Absolutely great play back to back days with 100 point trade. I am still in Japan. I will come back home at the end of this week. So I know it's a weird set up but bear with me. Alright? That's my trade recap.
