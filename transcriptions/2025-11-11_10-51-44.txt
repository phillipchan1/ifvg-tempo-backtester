What is going on guys? Tempo trades. We are coming at you one and oh on the day three and one on the callouts in the stream but we just took one win on the fundage. Let me show you what we took right here. So here is the trade we took. We took this one-minute IFEG for about 25 points. Why did I take this setup? It was I think I gave it a B+ in the stream. We have a bullish SMT here. You could see NQ sweeps these lows. ES does not sweep these lows. So there's your bullish divergence. In addition to that we were also tapping this one hour fair value gap down here. So that's another confluence and then confluence number three is just the good momentum. You could see the strength of these green candles here. So that was about it. If you entered on the close like I did you could see it's a little bit over a one-to-one. Yeah it's 25 points right there. So I trimmed 70% of my position here. I was gonna go down to one runner when it hit this but it didn't hit it. If I show you here was the call out and then here's me saying I'm trimming. So the the objective today was very very clear. Today's a bank holiday. We're not gonna look for a hundred point trade and be greedy. We're just gonna take what the market gives us and I even said it right here. I'm gonna play defensive and go for a base hit. So that's exactly what we did. After that there was this ES short right here that we did call out on stream. You could see ES taps the yellow line which is 50% of the daily range. That's a huge resistance level. We're now expecting shorts to bounce off of this and move lower and if you took the one minute you captured about nine points right there. So yeah those are those are the two main trade. Just quick and easy. We've been green every day this week so far. Let's keep it moving and if you have any questions about these trades let me know.
