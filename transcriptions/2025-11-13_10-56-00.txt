Alright, what is going on guys? Pretty easy day today. We just took a quick 40 point long. I have to even look at where I took it. Hold on. At 9.43 on the two minute time frame. Oh wait, right here. Okay, so here's the trade I took right here. This was a 40 point long. It was very very quick and the crazy part is price actually wicked me out by like one point. It would have went for like 60 I think but it is what it is. I ended up catching my base hit regardless. Why did I take this trade? We're in discount of the range so we want to be longing. We swept a ton of sell side levels. If I go to the hourly chart we swept all these sell side levels here. We also tapped into this hourly gap and then last but not least we tapped into the new week opening gap down here. So there's just a ton of confluences telling us that price could reverse at that area. So yeah, I had to chase. I got in half size and I ended up taking a trim at 35 points right here. Boom. I think my fill is 350 is what I said and then yeah and then I ended up trimming right there at like 37 points right there. So in total it would have went 70. This little red candle wicked me out by one point but this would have went for 70. So nice little move. It happened pretty quickly but nice little move. You could see here I called it out. I said right here and and that was it. That was it. Other than that the only other thing really was you could see we have the 50% of the daily range. Price missed it by one or two points which is what you really don't see that often and it still rejected the 50 and sold off all the way back down to the bottom. So pretty clean moves all things considered. I just took my base hit right now or at the bottom of the range so this is the area where you'd be looking for longs again.
