What is going on guys, tempo trades. We were I believe two and oh today we took four total trades on the fundage two of them were break even two of them were wins it was 20 points and 30 points let's go over everything because there were so many trades I'm just using my live stream to remind myself so the first thing I did right here is I did the NFP eval method and you could see here that I showed my executions walls in the trade the candle was a little weird it actually didn't fill me right away but then once it did fill me it went all the way to TP and you could just see that getting hit live here hold on you'd see that getting hit live here so I passed three apex evals off of that so that was the first thing I did here's the profits to the trade next up I took this short right here now this was a London high sweep as well as a data low target so really good trade the only negative is that because we pumped so fast we created a ton of gaps down here so price was struggling to get through those and that's the main reason why I believe this one was break even yeah this one was break even yeah so there's a break even trade right there again I was targeting the data low and that didn't hit trade number two I actually got back in short here once we created this 30 second order block the order block is just the green candle followed by the red candle where the red candle closes below the body I should draw it right here yeah I drew it right there so I got back in on that order block I went break even once we swept the swing low once again still targeting this data low same exact trade idea and that didn't work either just back to break even so very very wiki very very choppy and then where's trade number three this might have been let me say hold on dude okay this might have been trade number three right here so at about 855 we came up we swept the hourly high so did ES so we're in premium we got these sweeps we were also tapping an hourly fair value gap so textbook trade for me took that one there and this one I believe I caught 20 points yeah so this one I caught 20 points there you could see my fill was about two four three and then it went all the way down to about 220 so 20 points there and then my fourth and final trade I caught 30 points I basically reentered on this combined 30 second IFEG it's the same trade idea as the previous trade but we came up we retested this imbalance rejected it went into a IFEG and I was also targeting these equal lows right here very very high probability that these equal lows get hit that's a strong draw on liquidity so I got in there and then boom that one worked for 30 points right there so those are really the main trades that I took unfortunately we didn't hit the data low and if I kind of this was an eval trade that I called on stream but if I kind of go to current price price didn't do a whole lot I'm not too mad at it because the last two days have been extremely volatile and we've gotten some ridiculous moves so we're kind of due to get a day like this it's completely fine you just have to survive and don't do anything stupid because you know this is very very choppy very very wiki even though the range is pretty big we're not expanding we're just kind of consolidating internally so yeah that was that was what I did today it's really nice I will say it's really nice to get the news back with NFP and all that and I'm looking forward to it we have PMI tomorrow and then I think we even have EPI next week yeah so really excited to get the news back
