What is going on guys tempo trades great end to the week we have been green every single day this week today was no different one and oh on the day let me show you so here was yesterday two wins zero losses here was Wednesday three wins one loss here is Tuesday the reason why I'm green this day is because the win was way bigger than the loss here was the win the win was a hundred points I think the loss was like 20 and then Monday two and zero loss so we're ending the day five for five really happy about that this is the trade that we took right here so at basically 945 we came out with flash manufacturing PMI it didn't look like we were gonna get a data candle but we end up we did end up getting one so let me show you just go back here okay so here was the trade so here is the data candle right at 945 this was a 70 point candle so I mean pretty good it's it doesn't really look like a data candle based on the volatility but because we had a top wick there I decided like you know what I'm gonna try it and that is what I did so data wick okay so boom yeah so very very clean this was also off of the 50% tap so it kind of lined up perfectly you could see even on the right we basically hit the 50% level on both NQ and ES or get very very close to it we also form a bullish 30 second order block confirming that bullish order flow you did have to chase on this candle right here and then if you took it it was over a one-to-two risk to reward it went for about 53 points and our stop was about 25 points so yeah that was my win just a little like PSA man this has been the most volatility I have ever seen since probably April when we were doing the tariff crashes right and I can't really put I honestly can't put a finger on the volatility it could be because of the government shutdowns over it could be earnings like we had Nvidia earnings yesterday and the week the market's been extremely volatile the Fed said something yesterday and the market dumped a thousand points but like every day this week we've had three four five hundred point morning ranges which is unheard of and you just have to navigate it like you have to adapt right now the new 40 points is the new 20 points right now and it's just crazy like you can't take a five or ten point gap right now because the one-minute candle every one minute candles like 50 points so what's gonna happen if price test that ten point gap it's gonna obliterate it like it's not even there so I don't expect this to be a long-term thing I think this is just short-term market volatility but you have to adapt lower your sizing hold for bigger moves instead of trimming at 20 points trim at 30 40 50 points you know and just adapt and it's still possible to make money like I called out for winning trades on stream today did you have to chase on them yes you did have to chase but if you adapt and you know you know what to do you're still making money in this market you know so let me show you here was the first trade this was the first win that I took let me lower this so here's the first tray that I took then you have the next trade which was the short that I also called out off of the sweep again you had to chase just because this volatility is insane then you had this long that also worked this one was a not really a chase so this was probably the easiest trade to catch if you did this was off the 50% tap and the SMT then you had let's see then you had this one that worked for 30 points this was a one-to-one risk to reward if you just took that long so like there was a lot of opportunity to make money today you just have to adjust with the volatility so that is it for me hopefully your week went well we will be back here Monday to continue and I'm just happy the government shutdowns over I'm happy that we're getting news back again in the markets and we have PPI next week so that should be fun and yeah just just keep pushing through man if you're listening to this keep pushing through I promise you it will be worth it all right we'll see you next week
